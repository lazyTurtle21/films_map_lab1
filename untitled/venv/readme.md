<h1>Sophia Kholod`s films map(lab1)</h1>
<h2>How to use:</h2>
1) Run python program<br>
2) Enter the year in which films were made (from 1888 to 2026)<br>
3) Enter the max number of markers which will be shown on map. <br>
   (I made it because geopy takes a long time to give the place latitude and longtitide<br>
   and also the map would be hard to understand and not user-friendly with such amount of markers)<br>
4) Run Kholod_Film_map.html to see the map.<br>
5) You can choose different colors for your map and different layers(each country has a color depending on its area or population)<br>
