<h1>Sophia Kholod`s films map(lab1)</h1>
<h2>How to use:</h2>
1) Run python program
2) Enter the year in which films were made (from 1888 to 2026)
3) Enter the max number of markers which will be shown on map. 
   (I made it because geopy takes a long time to give the place latitude and longtitide
   and also the map would be hard to understand and not user-friendly with such amount of markers)
4) Run Kholod_Film_map.html to see the map.
5) You can choose different colors for your map and different layers(each country has a color depending on its area or population)
